PhD Student in Machine Learning at UCL

I am a PhD student in the [Foundational AI CDT](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/study/cdt-foundational-ai/current-student-profiles) at University College London where I am supervised by [Jun Wang](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/jun.wang/). Previously, I obtained a MSc. in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning from UCL and a BSc in Economics from the University of Warwick.

My research interests during my PhD have been in the application of Game-Theoretic concepts to the study of multi-agent systems. I am currently interested in extending these frameworks to autonomous agents that interact through LLMs.

If you are interested in my work or would like to chat about common interests, potential collaborations etc... please do reach out!
